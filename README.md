Essentially, this is inspired by the <a href="https://github.com/JustS-js/CatTeleportMod-Fabric">CatTeleportMod-Fabric</a> project, implemented by <a href="https://github.com/JustS-js">JustS</a>.<br>
But my version has been rewritten from scratch and supports newer versions (at least 1.21.4 for sure)<br>
