Additionally
------
Essentially, this is inspired by the <a href="https://github.com/JustS-js/CatTeleportMod-Fabric">CatTeleportMod-Fabric</a> project, implemented by <a href="https://github.com/JustS-js">JustS</a>.

But my version has been rewritten from scratch and supports newer versions (at least 1.21.4 for sure)

Using the code
------
Although there is a license for this, I want to duplicate it here.

If you use my code or the code of the author of the idea, please consider adding links to the original authors. 

And please read the license. 
Thank you!
